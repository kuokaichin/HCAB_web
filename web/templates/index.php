			of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We build meaningful emotional connections with dementia patients weekly 
			one-on-one visits. We focus on what is still present in our buddies and improving the life that they have despite limitations.

			College students and dementia patients are not that different- they and their <highlight>families</highlight> are both 
			undergoing major transitions in their lives during which they must reassess priorities and cope with new challenges. 
			With dementia, the transitions can be devastating. Together we work to find the <highlight>courage</highlight> to face these challenges.

			We help to relax and engage our buddies, leading them to be more <highlight>cooperative</highlight> with the support staff. 
			Our visits provide a relief for nursing staff so that they can focus on their care-giving duties.

			Although we are looking to expand to other facilities, we currently visit patients at the <a

			Senior Life Rehabilitation Center</highlight></a> in Roslindale, MA (HSL). The facility's staff members strive to
			meet the needs of every resident while engaging them in fulfilling activities. The staff have been
			wonderfully supportive of our effort.

			Sometimes visiting with dementia victims can be difficult. We <highlight>support</highlight> our volunteers with an
			extensive training program with the help of healthcare professionals. This training is 
			aimed at both improving their weekly visits and overall understanding
			of how families work to cope with Alzheimer's. We view this education as essential, not only
			because it is likely that our volunteers will encounter someone with dementia during their lives, but	
			also because they need to be able to connect to their buddies' loved ones.

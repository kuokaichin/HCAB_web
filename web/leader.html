                        Ryan Christ is a Senior studying Applied Mathematics in Biology. He became interested 
in Alzheimer's disease before coming to Harvard while taking care of family members with the disease at home in 
Delaware. He uses statistical models to investigate the genetic basis of the disease as a member of the De Jager Lab 
at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Ryan's interest in connecting with other people led him to Tanzania where he 
volunteered as one of four Harvard undergraduates to help pilot a new mobile clinic program. In his future career, he 
hopes to continue advocating for Alzheimer's patients and using statistics to investigate paths to treatments. 
?Outside of medicine and mathematics, he enjoys reading history and playing the saxophone.

                        Jessica is a Senior studying Neurobiology and Global Health and Health Policy. She has always 
been fascinated by memory and memory disorder--they're what led her to neurobiology and later Alzheimer's Buddies! 
When she isn't working on Alzheimer's Buddies, you can find her working at the Psychiatry Neuroimaging Lab, taking 
meeting notes and event photos for the Dunster House Committee (go meese!) and venue managing campus performances for 
the Office for the Arts.

                        Kuo-Kai is a sophomore in Eliot House studying Chemical and Physical Biology with a planned secondary
						in Computer Science. He is keenly interested in the future of elderly care, having been brought up

						program. He is a big sports fan and loves chatting about baseball, especially the Yankees and Red Sox, with his buddy.
						Aside from being a co-director of the Alzheimer's Buddies, he works at the Shi Lab at Boston 
						Children's Hospital and is also working on an initiative to update and publish a guide to high school

                        Michelle is a junior in Quincy House joint concentrating in Neurobiology and Studies of Women, Gender & Sexuality. She became interested in geriatric care through bringing a music program to a nursing home of residents with late stage Alzheimer's during high school and witnessing the beauty of intergenerational friendships. Outside of Alzheimer's Buddies, she is a bit of a neurobiology and maternal health junkie and is the founder and President of the Harvard Undergraduate Maternal Health Initiative and she also works in the Kraviz Lab at Harvard Medical School (aka the fruit fly fight club ) where she studies the mechanisms of memory in Drosophila aggression. She also enjoys cooking and eating delicious food and reading short stories and the NY Times Modern Love column (especially on Sundays to her wonderful buddy).               </div>
